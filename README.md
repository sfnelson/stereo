# History

This project was a collaboration between graduate students at Victoria University of Wellington, starting in 2008 shortly after the release of the iPhone. The project started as a way to distribute control of the grad lab (Memphis) stereo system, but became a reverse engineering project to understand the (new at the time) Apple Remote app for iTunes. Students could browse and stream music from their own iTunes libraries and modify the upcoming playlist using a the DACP protocol developed by Apple for iTunes and the original iPhone.

Stereo was origionally hosted on [Google Code](https://codesite-archive.appspot.com/archive/p/stereo/). This is a historical archive not working software.

## Installation (from google code wiki)

### Dependencies
For MPRIS support, you will need to install libmatthew-java (from our downloads here) and [dbus-java](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-java/dbus-java-2.5.1.tar.gz).

## Clients (from google code wiki)

Stereo supports multiple controllers, or clients, connecting via the daap protocol.

### Details
Available daap clients which have been tested with Stereo:

Apple's Remote.app (iPhone) - reference client
Stereo's Java client (in stereo tree) - not feature complete
Ruby client written for Stereo - http://gitorious.com/projects/ruby-dacp
Javascript client (in stereo tree)
